        <p class="exp">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that my experience as a junior high
          school student was something is an understatement. It was a
          rollercoaster ride of emotions, growth, learning, and more, in both
          good and bad. What made my years in junior high school more memorable
          are the friends I made. Even though I've fallen out with most of them
          during the pandemic, I still hold fond memories of our friendships. My
          teachers throughout the years have also made an impact in my junior
          high years. <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I especially missed before the pandemic
          happened were the events I joined, dancing events, to be specific.
          Dancing was and still is my passion. The ability to execute my skills
          to a crowd was thrilling. I had always looked forward to learning and
          practicing choreography. If there was an occasion that dancing is
          involved, you could already count on me being there. It is such a
          shame that the latest event I joined, the year's theater performance,
          was cut short due to the pandemic. I haven't accomplished many.
          However, I had overcome a lot, particularly in my productivity and
          social activity. Although that had deteriorated since the pandemic, I
          still look forward to overcoming them once again nonetheless. Overall,
          I love my experience as a junior high student and would relive it any
          day. I am proud of who I am today, and I look forward to what the
          future has in store for me.
