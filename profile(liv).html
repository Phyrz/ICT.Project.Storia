        <p class="exp">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far in high school, my life has been a
          bumpy road. It was More demanding than easy because so much of my time
          was spent caring for my mental health Rather than actually focusing on
          doing better at school. Itâ€™s only because of the people with whom I
          Have formed bonds and shared memories that I have been able to get
          through such difficult times. Even though we don't talk as much as we
          used to anymore because of how they either left TayTung or because we
          simply lost touch with one another, I still hold on to the precious
          Memories we shared over the past four years. With the memories spent
          together with teachers, batchmates, and even with students from
          different grades, I was able to enjoy life just a bit more because of
          them. I joined the Aikido club, which my friend and I were really
          looking forward to progressing in, I joined events to dance in such as
          the United Nations event, as well as the Alumni night which was
          together with complete strangers that I soon got to bond with so
          quickly. Everything until 8th grade was doing amazing until the
          pandemic happened during 2021, my life Completely changed ever since.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mental health, which was already
          suffering, became Significantly worse. I entirely neglected the
          important tasks, which was extremely foolish of me. I'm Now trying my
          best now that I have realized my mistakes, and I have hope that I'll
          be able to make it. My life so far has been a huge mess, but it was
          fun. I'm so happy I got to spend it with wonderful people and have
          been able to enjoy life because of them. I hope that in the future, I
          will be able to live better than I was able to throughout high school
          and that I will be able to live my life to the fullest, as I hope that
          others who also did not have the opportunity to do so will be able to
          do so as well.
